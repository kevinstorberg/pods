# Project Configuration

## Project Directory
The actual project directory relative to the PODs framework location:
**PROJECT_DIRECTORY**: ".."

When PODs is installed in `my-project/pods/`, this points to `my-project/` as the target project directory.

## Usage
All roles should analyze and work on files in the PROJECT_DIRECTORY, not the PODs framework directory itself.
