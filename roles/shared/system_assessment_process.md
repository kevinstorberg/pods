- **Examine existing codebase** structure, patterns, and architecture
- **Identify current technology stack** and dependencies
- **Map existing workflows** and development processes
- **Document current capabilities** and limitations
- **Assess integration points** and dependencies
- **Understand existing quality standards** and practices
- **Evaluate technical debt** and improvement opportunities
