# Example Quality Indicators

## Good Examples (Specific and Actionable)
**Good**: "As a content manager, I want to upload documents (PDF, DOC, XLS up to 50MB) and receive automated content analysis within 30 seconds so I can quickly review submissions during high-volume periods"

**Good**: "Implement `ContentProcessingService` class in `backend/app/services/` using dependency injection pattern with `ExternalAPIClient` for processing calls and `CloudStorageRepository` for file storage, supporting async processing with task queue"

**Good**: "Create automated API tests for user management endpoints using testing framework, validating request/response schemas, authentication headers, error status codes, and data persistence across POST, GET, PUT, DELETE operations"

## Bad Examples (Vague and Non-actionable)
**Bad**: "Users want better document analysis"

**Bad**: "Create a service to process content"

**Bad**: "Add some API tests"
