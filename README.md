# PODs - AI-Powered Development Framework

A comprehensive AI development framework that functions like a complete Agile Software Engineering Team, with specialized AI agents embodying different professional roles working together to deliver projects from concept to completion.

## 🎯 Purpose

PODs transforms how software is built by providing a structured framework where AI agents collaborate systematically across the entire development lifecycle. Each agent embodies the expertise and responsibilities of key software development roles, enabling teams to:

- **Scale development capacity** with AI-powered professional roles
- **Maintain consistent quality** through structured workflows and handoffs
- **Reduce project complexity** with clear role separation and documentation
- **Accelerate delivery** through parallel workstreams and automated planning

## 🏗️ How It Works

### The Role-Based Workflow

PODs uses a sequential workflow where each role builds upon the previous role's output:

```
Product Manager → Architect → Engineering Manager → Fullstack Engineer → QA Engineer
```

#### 1. **Product Manager**
- Analyzes requirements and defines product specifications
- Creates comprehensive business requirements and user stories
- **Output**: `/branch/{feature}_product_spec.md`

#### 2. **Architect**
- Reviews product specifications and designs technical architecture
- Defines system design, technology choices, and implementation approach
- **Input**: Product specifications from PM
- **Output**: `/branch/{feature}_architecture_spec.md`

#### 3. **Engineering Manager**
- Breaks down architecture into actionable development tickets
- Plans implementation phases and coordinates development work
- **Input**: Architecture specifications from Architect
- **Output**: `/branch/{feature}_tickets.md`

#### 4. **Fullstack Engineer**
- Implements features based on detailed tickets and specifications
- Writes code following architectural guidelines and quality standards
- **Input**: Implementation tickets from Engineering Manager
- **Output**: Working code implementation

#### 5. **QA Engineer**
- Reviews implementation against all specifications and requirements
- Validates quality, tests functionality, and provides final approval
- **Input**: Code implementation + all previous specifications
- **Output**: `/branch/{feature}_qa_report.md`

### Supporting Roles

- **Designer**: Creates user experience designs and design systems
- **Admin**: Handles project initialization and configuration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Your Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pods.git
cd your-project-directory
# Run initialization script (coming soon)
./init-project.sh
```

### 2. Configure Project Context

The initialization process will:
- Auto-detect your technology stack
- Prompt for business context and constraints
- Generate project-specific configuration files
- Set up the `/branch` workspace for generated content

### 3. Invoke Roles Sequentially

Start with the Product Manager and work through the role chain:

```bash
# Example role invocation (implementation details coming soon)
pods invoke product-manager --feature "user-authentication"
pods invoke architect --feature "user-authentication"
pods invoke engineering-manager --feature "user-authentication"
pods invoke fullstack-engineer --feature "user-authentication"
pods invoke qa-engineer --feature "user-authentication"
```

## 🎨 Key Features

### Context-Driven Intelligence
- **Domain Agnostic**: Roles adapt to any industry through context injection
- **Project Aware**: Auto-detection of existing codebases and technology stacks
- **Constraint Conscious**: Respects timeline, budget, and technical limitations

### Template-Based Consistency
- **Standardized Outputs**: Consistent document formats across all roles
- **Variable Substitution**: Dynamic content generation with `{{VARIABLE}}` system
- **Modular Components**: DRY architecture with shared, reusable components

### Clean Workspace Management
- **Git-Ignored Generation**: All AI outputs go to `/branch` folder
- **Session Isolation**: Timestamped workspaces for parallel feature development
- **Version Control Friendly**: Framework stays clean, generated content stays separate
