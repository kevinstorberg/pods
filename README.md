# PODs - AI-Powered Development Framework

A comprehensive AI development framework that functions like a complete Agile Software Engineering Team, with specialized AI agents embodying different professional roles working together to deliver projects from concept to completion.

## 🎯 Purpose

PODs transforms how software is built by providing a structured framework where AI agents collaborate across the entire development lifecycle. Each agent embodies the expertise and responsibilities of key software development roles, enabling teams to:

- **Scale development capacity** with AI-powered professional roles
- **Maintain consistent quality** through structured workflows and handoffs
- **Reduce project complexity** with clear role separation and documentation
- **Accelerate delivery** through parallel workstreams and automated planning

## 🏗️ How It Works

### The Role-Based Workflow

PODs uses a sequential workflow where each role builds upon the previous role's output:

```
Product Manager → Architect → Engineering Manager → Fullstack Engineer → QA Engineer
```

#### 1. **Product Manager**
- Analyzes requirements and defines product specifications
- Creates comprehensive business requirements and user stories
- **Output**: `/branch/requirements_doc.md` and `/branch/user_stories.md`

#### 2. **Architect**
- Reviews product specifications and designs technical architecture
- Defines system design, technology choices, and implementation approach
- **Input**: `/branch/requirements_doc.md` and `/branch/user_stories.md` from Product Manager
- **Output**: `/branch/architecture_spec.md`

#### 3. **Engineering Manager**
- Breaks down architecture into actionable development tickets
- Plans implementation phases and coordinates development work
- **Input**: `/branch/architecture_spec.md` from Architect
- **Output**: `/branch/tickets.md` and `/branch/implementation_plan.md`

#### 4. **Fullstack Engineer**
- Implements features based on detailed tickets and specifications
- Writes code following architectural guidelines and quality standards
- **Input**: `/branch/tickets.md` and `/branch/implementation_plan.md` from Engineering Manager
- **Output**: Working code implementation

#### 5. **QA Engineer**
- Reviews implementation against all specifications and requirements
- Validates quality, tests functionality, and provides final approval
- **Input**: Code implementation + all previous deliverables from upstream roles
- **Output**: `/branch/qa_report.md`

### Supporting Roles

- **Designer**: Creates user experience designs and design systems
- **Output**: `/branch/design_task.md` and `/branch/design_system.md`
- **Admin**: Handles project initialization and configuration

## 📄 PDF Generation

PODs can convert all markdown deliverables to professional PDFs for stakeholder review:

```bash
# Convert all deliverables to PDF
bin/pods g pdf --a

# Convert specific deliverable
bin/pods g pdf requirements_doc.md

# PDFs are saved to /tmp directory
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For New Projects

#### 1. Set Up PODs Framework

```bash
# Clone the PODs framework to your project
git clone https://github.com/kevinstorberg/pods.git
cd pods

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Configure AI Assistants

Edit the configuration file to set your preferred AI coding tools:

```bash
# Edit config/assistants.jsonc
```

Supported AI assistants:
- `claude` - Claude AI coding assistant
- `codex` - Codex AI coding assistant
- `gemini` - Gemini AI coding assistant

Example configuration:
```javascript
{
  // Default AI assistant for all roles
  "default": "claude",

  // Role-specific overrides (uncomment as needed)
  "roles": {
    // "fullstack_engineer": "codex",
    // "engineering_manager": "gemini"
  }
}
```

### 3. Configure MCP Servers (Optional)

Configure Model Context Protocol servers for enhanced AI capabilities:

```bash
# Edit config/mcp.json
# Supports JSONC format with comments
# Uncomment desired servers and add API keys
```

Example MCP configuration:
```javascript
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // Uncomment and configure as needed
    // "figma-community": {
    //   "command": "npx",
    //   "args": ["-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY"],
    //   "env": {
    //     "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR-FIGMA-API-KEY"
    //   }
    // },
    // "github": {
    //   "command": "npx",
    //   "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    //   "env": {
    //     "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN"
    //   }
    // }
  }
}
```

### 4. Initialize Project Context

Run the admin role to configure your project context:

```bash
# Make scripts executable (one-time setup)
chmod +x bin/pods bin/initialize

# Option 1: Use initialize script (recommended)
bin/initialize

# Option 2: Launch admin role directly
bin/pods admin
```

The admin will:
- Auto-detect your technology stack
- Ask smart questions about your business context
- Configure all project context files
- Prepare the framework for other roles

### 5. Use Roles Sequentially

Work through the role chain for your feature development:

```bash
# Basic usage
bin/pods product_manager
bin/pods pm                    # Abbreviation

# Advanced options
bin/pods fe --t               # Open in new terminal tab
bin/pods ar --a gemini        # Override AI assistant
bin/pods pm --t --a codex     # New tab + assistant override

# Generator commands
bin/pods g tree feature-auth  # Create worktree + branch
cd ../feature-auth            # Change to new worktree directory
bin/pods g pdf --a            # Convert all deliverables to PDF
bin/pods g pdf requirements_doc.md  # Convert specific file to PDF
```

### For Existing Projects

#### 1. Add PODs to Your Existing Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your existing project root
cd my-existing-project

# Add PODs framework as a git subtree
git subtree add --prefix=pods https://github.com/kevinstorberg/pods.git main --squash

# Navigate to PODs directory
cd pods

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x bin/pods bin/initialize
```

#### 2. Configure for Your Existing Project

```bash
# The project.json already points to parent directory (..)
# Configure AI assistants as needed
# Edit config/assistants.json
# Edit config/mcp.json (optional)
```

#### 3. Analyze Your Existing Codebase

```bash
# Run admin to analyze your existing project
bin/pods admin
```

The Admin will automatically analyze your existing codebase in the parent directory, detect your tech stack, and configure PODs contexts based on your project structure.
